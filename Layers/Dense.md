Keras Dense layers represent a densely conencted NN layer. Another name for this type of layer is fully connected

It implements the operation

$$ A(Input\cdot{}Kernel + bias) $$

**Activation** is the element-wise activation function

**Kernel** is a weights matrix created by the layer

**Bias** is a bias vector created by the layer (*optional*)
