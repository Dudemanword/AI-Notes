What does an artificial neuron do?

- Takes an input
- Processes it
- Sends it through an activation function
- Return the activated output

Computes some function *f* of the weighted sum of its inputs

$$ y_i = f(\sum_{j} w_{ij}y_j)$$

$w_i$ is the weight applied to some input $y$. As far as I'm aware, $y_i$ can be some type of constant or function
