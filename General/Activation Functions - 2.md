Recall that a neuron is defined as:

$$ y_i = f(\sum_{j} (w_{ij}y_j) + b_i)$$

such that 

$$ -\infty \leq y_i \leq \infty $$

The neuron doesn't know when to fire because the neuron itself doesn't know what value means "fire". **Activation functions** exist to fire the neuron when the appropriate "fire" value is hit.

This is achieved by using some activation function $A(x)$
